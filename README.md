Hangman on the Command Line

This Node.js command line application is a fun (if not super geeky) version of hangman! This was my first use of constructor functions; how have I lived without them!? Users can pick a category to guess words from, and then...well, we all know how Hangman works! Check back for a video of the app in action!
